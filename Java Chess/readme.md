# Chess Game - Java OOP Project

## Project Overview

This project is a chess game built using Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java. The game simulates a fully functional chessboard with two players (human vs. human). It includes all the standard rules of chess, such as piece movement, castling, en passant, pawn promotion, and check/checkmate detection.

## Features

### 1. **Chessboard Representation**

-   The chessboard is represented using an 8x8 grid.
-   Each square can hold a chess piece or be empty.
-   The chess pieces are represented as objects, allowing for easy management and movement.

### 2. **Piece Movement**

-   Each piece (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn) has specific movement rules.
-   Valid movement is determined based on the piece type and its position on the board.
-   Special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion are supported.

### 3. **Game Logic**

-   The game enforces standard chess rules, including:
    -   Turn-based play (white goes first).
    -   Check and checkmate detection.
    -   Stalemate and draw conditions.
    -   Pawn promotion (to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight).

### 4. **User Interface**

-   The game is played through the console (CLI), where players input their moves using standard chess notation (e.g., e2 to e4).
-   A simple and clear display of the board after each move.
-   Instructions and feedback are provided to guide players.
